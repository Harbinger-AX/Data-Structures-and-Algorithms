# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Repository of projects created for CS300

#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
	The projects were concerned with parsing through datasets for a colleges course offerings.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
	Different structures are better for certain applications, so it was important to consider which ones would be best suited for a particular problem.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
	I frequented StackOverflow and GitHub to review common solutions to problems that I was having to see how others approached them.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
	This course has shown me how important it is to consider the best solutions to a particular problem, because it can improve program runtime and ultimaely improve efficiency and functionality for the end user.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	I now make sure to include lots of inline comments so that anyone picking up the code to work on it can read it and understand it.
